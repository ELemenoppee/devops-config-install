# ðŸš€ Setting Up Kubernetes Dashboard: My Step-by-Step Guide

![alt text](images/image.png)

Managing a Kubernetes cluster efficiently requires a robust interface, and thatâ€™s where the Kubernetes Dashboard comes in. This web-based UI allows me to monitor, troubleshoot, and manage my cluster with ease.

In this guide, Iâ€™ll walk you through the entire process of setting up and accessing the Kubernetes Dashboard. By the end, you'll have a fully functional dashboard, making cluster management more intuitive and streamlined. Let's dive in!

## ðŸ“Œ Prerequisites

Before I begin, I made sure I had the following:

âœ… A running Kubernetes cluster

âœ… kubectl installed and configured

âœ… Access to the cluster's master node

## Step 1: Access the Master Node

First, I logged into the master node of my Kubernetes cluster:

```sh
ssh user@my-master-node
```

## Step 2: Deploy Kubernetes Dashboard

To install the Kubernetes Dashboard, I applied the official YAML manifest:

```
$ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/dashboard/v2.7.0/aio/deploy/recommended.yaml
```

## Step 3: Verify the Deployment

I ensured that all necessary resources had been successfully installed by running:

```
$ kubectl get all -n kubernetes-dashboard
```

Expected output:

```
root@k8prod-master-01:~# kubectl get all -n kubernetes-dashboard
NAME                                             READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
pod/dashboard-metrics-scraper-5657497c4c-5bqj8   1/1     Running   0          2m13s
pod/kubernetes-dashboard-78f87ddfc-kg5xh         1/1     Running   0          2m13s

NAME                                TYPE        CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
service/dashboard-metrics-scraper   ClusterIP   10.96.127.30     <none>        8000/TCP   2m14s
service/kubernetes-dashboard        ClusterIP   10.102.157.143   <none>        443/TCP    2m14s

NAME                                        READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
deployment.apps/dashboard-metrics-scraper   1/1     1            1           2m13s
deployment.apps/kubernetes-dashboard        1/1     1            1           2m14s

NAME                                                   DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE
replicaset.apps/dashboard-metrics-scraper-5657497c4c   1         1         1       2m13s
replicaset.apps/kubernetes-dashboard-78f87ddfc         1         1         1       2m14s

```

## Step 4: Expose the Dashboard Using NodePort

By default, the Kubernetes Dashboard is only accessible within the cluster. To make it accessible externally, I modified the service type:

```
$ kubectl edit service/kubernetes-dashboard -n kubernetes-dashboard
```

I found the following line:

```
  type: ClusterIP
```

And changed it to:

```
  type: NodePort
```

After saving and exiting, I verified the update.

## Step 5: Verify the Service Exposure

I ran the command below to check if the service type had been updated successfully:

```sh
kubectl get service -n kubernetes-dashboard
```

The output looked like this:

```
NAME                   TYPE       CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)         AGE
kubernetes-dashboard   NodePort   10.102.157.143   <none>        443:30861/TCP   9m
```

I noted the NodePort value (30861 in this example), as Iâ€™d need it to access the Dashboard.

## Step 6: Create an Admin Service Account

To access the Dashboard with full privileges, I created a service account and role binding.

First, I created a new directory and YAML file:

```
$ mkdir dashboard
$ cd dashboard
$ vi k8s-serviceaccount.yaml
```

Then, I added the following configuration:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: dashboard-admin
  namespace: kubernetes-dashboard
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: cluster-admin-rolebinding
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: cluster-admin
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: dashboard-admin
  namespace: kubernetes-dashboard
```

I saved the file and applied it using:

```
$ kubectl apply -f k8s-serviceaccount.yaml
```

## Step 7: Generate an Authentication Token

To log in to the Dashboard, I needed an authentication token. I generated one using:

```
$ kubectl create token dashboard-admin -n kubernetes-dashboard
```

I copied and saved this token securely for the next step.

## Step 8: Access the Kubernetes Dashboard

Now, I could access the Dashboard by opening the following URL in my browser:

```
http://<MASTER_IP_ADDRESS>:<KUBERNETES_DASHBOARD_SERVICE_PORT>/
```

I replaced <MASTER_IP_ADDRESS> with my Kubernetes master node's IP and <NODEPORT> with the port number from Step 5 (e.g., 30861).

## Step 9: Log In to the Dashboard

When prompted, I selected Token authentication and pasted the token generated in Step 7. I clicked Sign In, and that was it! I now had full access to my Kubernetes Dashboard.

## ðŸŽ¯ Wrapping Up

And thatâ€™s it! I successfully set up and accessed the Kubernetes Dashboard. Now, I can manage workloads, troubleshoot issues, and monitor my cluster more efficiently.
