# üêßHow to Integrate GitHub Webhooks with Jenkins: A Complete Step-by-Step Guide

I wanted to automate my CI/CD pipeline so that every time I pushed code to GitHub, Jenkins would automatically trigger a build. To achieve this, I set up GitHub Webhooks with Jenkins, allowing seamless integration between the two.

In this guide, I‚Äôll walk you through the exact steps I followed to make it work. By the end, you‚Äôll be able to:

‚úÖ Configure GitHub webhooks to communicate with Jenkins

‚úÖ Set up Jenkins to automatically trigger builds on code commits

‚úÖ Verify and troubleshoot the integration to ensure everything runs smoothly

Let‚Äôs dive in! üöÄ

## Step 1: Configuring GitHub Repository Settings

First, I opened my GitHub repository, clicked on Settings, and navigated to the Webhooks section.

Then, I clicked Add Webhook and filled in the details:

In the Payload URL field, I entered my Jenkins server URL followed by /github-webhook/.

Under Content type, I selected application/json.

I left the Secret field empty (but you can set one for added security).

For SSL Verification, I disabled it (not recommended for production but useful for testing).

Finally, I clicked Add Webhook to save my settings.

## Step 2: Setting Up Jenkins to Receive Webhooks

Next, I switched to Jenkins and created a new project:

Clicked New Item in Jenkins.

Gave my project a name, selected Freestyle Project, and clicked OK.

Click on the ‚ÄòSource Code Management‚Äô tab.

Under Source Code Management, I selected Git and pasted my GitHub repository URL in the Repository URL field.

In the Build Triggers section, I checked GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling to allow automatic builds whenever I push changes.

## Step 3: Testing Automatic Jenkins Builds on GitHub Commits

Now, I needed to make sure Jenkins was correctly triggered whenever I pushed new code.

I went to the Build section, clicked Add build step, and selected Execute shell.

Inside the script field, I added a simple command to test my setup.

I made a small edit in one of my GitHub repository files and committed the change.

As soon as I pushed the changes, Jenkins automatically started a new build!

I went back to my Jenkins dashboard and saw that a job had been triggered. To check the logs, I clicked on the Console Output of the build.

## üéØ Final Thoughts

Setting up GitHub webhooks with Jenkins was a game-changer for my CI/CD workflow. Now, every time I push changes to GitHub, Jenkins automatically takes care of the build process‚Äîsaving me time and effort.
